# BLE ePaper for Home Assistant

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that supports BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) ePaper
ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) displays.

Currently, this integration supports BLE ePaper displays from Picksmart, also known as Gicisky.

## Installation

HACS installation is upcoming, once this integration leaves beta state.

## Supported devices

This integration supports most, but not all, of Gicisky/Picksmart devices.

**Only devices with BW (Black/White) and BWR (Black/White/Red) pixels are supported.**

The devices on this list should work in theory, but only those with a check mark
in the Verified column have actually been verified to work.
